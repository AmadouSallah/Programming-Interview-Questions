Suppose you have an array of n+1 integers. The integers are in random order, but you know each of the integers is between 1 and n (inclusive). In addition, each number appears only once in the array, except for one number, which occurs twice. Describe an algorithm to find the repeated number in the most efficient way, that is in
0(n) time and 0(1) space.
