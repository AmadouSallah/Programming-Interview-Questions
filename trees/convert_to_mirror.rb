# Problem: Write a program to convert a Binary Tree into its Mirror Tree
# A mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.
# Example:
#      1
#    /    \
#   2      3
#  / \    /
# 4   5  6
#       /
#      8

# becomes
#      1
#    /    \
#   3      2
#  / \      \
# 5   4      6
#              \
#                8
