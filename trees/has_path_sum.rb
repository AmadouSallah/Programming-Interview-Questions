# Problem: Given a binary tree and a number, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path
# such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given number.
# Return false if no such path can be found.

# Example, for the binary tree below,
#      1
#    /    \
#   2      3
#  / \    /
# 4   5  6
#       /
#      8
# the root to leaf path sums are: 7 => 1 2 4; 8 => 1 2 5; 18 => 1 3 6 8
# The function will return true for numbers 7, 8, or 18, and false otherwise
