# Given the root of a binary tree, print out the tree in zig zag level order
# (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
# Output a newline after the end of each level.

#      1
#    /    \
#   2      3
#  / \    / \
# 4   5  6   7
# Example, for the tree above, the zig zag level order output is:
# 1
# 3 2
# 4 5 6 7
