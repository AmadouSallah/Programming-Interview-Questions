# Problem: Given a binary tree, print out the tree in level order (ie, from left to right, level by level). Output a newline after the end of each level
# For example, for the following binary tree,

#      1
#    /    \
#   2      3
#  / \    / \
# 4   5  6   7

# the output will be:
# 1
# 2 3
# 4 5 6 7
