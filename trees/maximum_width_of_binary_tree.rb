# Problem: Given a binary tree, write a program to find the maximum width (also called diameter) of the tree.
# The width of a tree is the maximum of widths of all levels
# Example
#      1
#    /    \
#   2      3
#  / \    /
# 4   5  6
#       /
#      8

# For the binary tree above, width of level 1 = 1, width of level 2 = 2, width of level 3 = 3, and width of level 4 = 1.
# The program would therefore return 3 for the above tree
