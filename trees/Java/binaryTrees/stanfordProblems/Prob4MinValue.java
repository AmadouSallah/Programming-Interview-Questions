/*
minValue()
Given a non-empty binary search tree (an ordered binary tree), return the minimum
data value found in that tree.
Note that it is not necessary to search the entire tree.
A maxValue() function is structurally very similar to this function.
This can be solved with recursion or with a simple while loop.
