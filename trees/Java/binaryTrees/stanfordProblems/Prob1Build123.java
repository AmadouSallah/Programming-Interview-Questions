/*
This is a very basic problem with a little pointer manipulation.
(You can skip this problem if you are already comfortable with pointers.)

Write code that builds the following little 1-2-3 binary search tree...
  2
 / \
1   3

Write the code in three different ways...
  a: by calling newNode() three times, and using three pointer variables
  b: by calling newNode() three times, and using only one pointer variable
  c: by calling insert() three times passing it the root pointer to build up the tree
