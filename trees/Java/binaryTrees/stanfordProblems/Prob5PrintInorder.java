/*
 printTree()

Given a binary search tree (aka an "ordered binary tree"), iterate over the nodes
to print them out in increasing order. So the tree...
       4
     /   \
    2     5
  /   \
 1     3
Produces the output "1 2 3 4 5". This is known as an "inorder" traversal of the tree.
Hint: For each node, the strategy is: recur left, print the node data, recur right.
