hasPathSum()

We'll define a "root-to-leaf path" to be a sequence of nodes in a tree
starting with the root node and proceeding downward to a leaf
(a node with no children). We'll say that an empty tree contains no
root-to-leaf paths. So for example, the following tree has exactly
four root-to-leaf paths:
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
Root-to-leaf paths:
 path 1: 5 4 11 7
 path 2: 5 4 11 2
 path 3: 5 8 13
 path 4: 5 8 4 1

For this problem, we will be concerned with the sum of the values of such a
path -- for example, the sum of the values on the 5-4-11-7 path is 5 + 4 + 11 + 7 = 27.

Given a binary tree and a sum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path
such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
Return false if no such path can be found.
