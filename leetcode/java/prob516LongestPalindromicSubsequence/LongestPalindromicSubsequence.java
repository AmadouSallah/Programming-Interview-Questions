https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/description/

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.
You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
Input: "bbbab"
Output: 4
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Example 2:
Input: "cbbd"
Output: 2
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
