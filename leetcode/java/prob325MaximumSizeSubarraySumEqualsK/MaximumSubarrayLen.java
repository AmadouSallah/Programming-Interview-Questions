/*
Problem 325: Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k

Given an array nums and a target value k, find the maximum length of a subarray that sums to k.
If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

Note:
The sum of the entire nums array is guaranteed to fit within the 32-bit signed integer range.

Example 1:
Given nums = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3], k = 3,
return 4. (because the subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] sums to 3 and is the longest)

Example 2:
Given nums = [-2, -1, 2, 1], k = 1,
return 2. (because the subarray [-1, 2] sums to 1 and is the longest)

Can you do it in O(n) time?
