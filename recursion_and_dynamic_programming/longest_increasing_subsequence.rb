# Problem: Given a sequence of numbers, write a program to find a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous)
# whose elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.

# Example:
# nums = [3, 4, -1, 0, 6, 2, 3] => output = [-1, 0, 2,3]
# nums = [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15] => output = [0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15]
