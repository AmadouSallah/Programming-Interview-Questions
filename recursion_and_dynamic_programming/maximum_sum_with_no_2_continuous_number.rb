# Problem: Given an array of numbers (not all negative), write a program to find the
# maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence
# should be adjacent in the array
# Answer the question in the most efficient way.

# Example:
# [3, 2, 7, 10] should return 13 (sum of 3 and 10);
# [3, 2, 5, 10, 7] should return 15 (sum of 3, 5 and 7).
