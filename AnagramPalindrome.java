/*
Given an input string s, write a program to check if any of its anagrams is a palindrome.
The program returns true if at least one of its anagrams is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example
for input s = "carrace", 2 of its anagrams, "racecar" and "carerac", are both palindromes => true
For s = "aac", an anagram of s is "aca", which is a palindrome => true
For s = "abc", none of its anagrams is a palindrome => false
s = "icvic", anagram "civic" is a palindrome, so return true
s = "civil", none of its anagrams is a palindrome, so return false
