# Problem: Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array.
# Example [3, 2, 7, 10] should return 13 (sum of 3 and 10);  [3, 2, 5, 10, 7] should return 15 (sum of 3, 5 and 7).
# Answer the question in most efficient way.
