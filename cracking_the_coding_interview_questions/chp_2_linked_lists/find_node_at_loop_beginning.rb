# Problem: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop

# DEFINITION
# Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list
# EXAMPLE
# Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier] Output: C
