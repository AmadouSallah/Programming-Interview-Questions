# Problem 1.6
# Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes,
# write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

# [1][2][3][4]             [3][9][5][1]
# [5][6][7][8]  BECOMES    [4][0][6][2]
# [9][0][1][2]             [5][1][7][3]
# [3][4][5][6]             [6][2][8][4]
