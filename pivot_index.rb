# Problem: Write a method that returns the "pivot" index of a list of integers.
# We define the pivot index as the index where the sum of the numbers on the left is equal to the sum of the numbers on the right.
# Example: Given [1, 4, 6, 3, 2], the method should return 2, since the sum of the numbers to the left of index 2 is equal to the sum of numbers to the right of index 2 (1 + 4 = 3 + 2).
# If no such index exists, it should return -1. If there are multiple pivots, you can return the left-most pivot.
